# ODR-Studio

ODR-Studio is a very basic (yet) concept of free, scallable, cross platform, responsive DAB+ studio web application. The idea is quite simple - to create a web app, that together with Open Digital Radio great tools will bring you a real radio studio experience and all of that directly from your browser.

### Features
* Can run on Linux, Windows, OS X
* UI works fine on mobile devices
* Displays info about currently played track
* Displays currently broadcasted MOT Slideshow
* Displays currently broadcasted  DLS
 
### What's next
The list of desired features is huge, the next goals are to implement:
* Play, Stop, Pause buttons
* Playlist
* Manual MOT Slideshow image upload
* MongoDB provider for app settings, DLS and MOT Slideshow images
* Music database management
* Step by step further VLC functionality
* Standalone web stream proxy in order to never turn down fdk-aac-dabplus encoder
* Support multiple audio sources and mix them in realtime, into web stream proxy (JACK maybe?)
* And many, many more
